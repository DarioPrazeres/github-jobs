Please do not submit Remotive jobs to third Party websites, including but not limited to: Jooble, Neuvoo, Google Jobs, LinkedIn Jobs. Please link back to the URL found on Remotive AND mention Remotive as a source in order to Remotive to get traffic from your listing. If you don't do that, we'll terminate your API access, sorry! Jobs displayed are delayed by 24 hours, the goal being that jobs are attributed to Remotive on various platforms. Displaying our jobs in order to collect signups/email addresses to show a listing constitutes a breach of our terms of services.

Please find out terms of services on https://remotive.com/api-documentation. Please note that there is absolutely no need to request Remotive Job data too frequently. Typically, you only need to GET Remotive job data through this API a couple of times a day (we advise max. 4 times a day). Our data is not changing much faster than that anyway.
